# CSCI160-CQ8-Optional-
Alternating Characters:
    * Time Complexity: O(n)
        - The worse case of the problem is when the function call all of the
          character once in the string, which is O(n)
    * Space Complexity: O(n)
        - It create a substring while running through each recursive call. Also since           there are only n characters, the worse case for space complexity is O(n)
